## Description

A backend application which provides an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friend's thoughts and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB for data storage and Mongoose ODM. Timestamps were formatted using Date-fns package.

A Postman collection file contains the seeded data.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

## Technical steps

- created `user` and `thought` models, together with `reaction` schema
- created virtuals to calculate total number of `reactions` for each `thought` and total number of `friends` for `user`
- created `API` routes and correspondent controller functions to `get all` users and thoughts, `get` user and thought by id, `create` user, thought, reaction and friend, `update` user, thought, reaction and friend, `delete` user, thought, reaction and friend
- synced Sequelize to MongoDB database using Mongoose
- tested all routes in Postman and attached a postman collection to the repo
